What:

**Presentation tool**

Category: 

- Hobby based
 
Why:

- I am very intrested in the art of presenting, and what makes a good presentation
- My goal with this project idea would be not just to create a presentation tool, but to create a presentation tool which has some form of restrictions; almost like a Linter would in programing. 

What is a Linter?

- A Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.

// Invoicing System
// Tag: Hobby based
// Why: 
// I was self employed for 3 years, for them 3 years, I used 3 systems to try and handle and present my invoicing.
// I used a tool called boost to track the ammount of hours I work on a given project.
// I then used a micrsoft spreadsheet, to calculate how much time should be charged.
// I then used adobe indesign, to create the final invoice to send to the client.
// I always wished that I could streamline this process as it used to take me around a 1/2 hours to complete each month.
// This could also be expanded to include my tax return records/spending, which is another process that takes alot of time for me to manage.
