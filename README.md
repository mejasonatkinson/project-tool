What:

**Presentation tool**

Category: 

- Hobby based
 
Why:

- I am very intrested in the art of presenting, and what makes a good presentation
- My goal with this project idea would be not just to create a presentation tool, but to create a presentation tool which has some form of restrictions; almost like a Linter would in programing. 

What is a Linter?

- A Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.

Tasks:

- [ ] Researching

**Top results**

[Create a Presentation Slide Website; Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE1m21Umn0s)

All they do is use another project called [webslides](https://github.com/webslides/webslides/) to create presentations in HTML, CSS & JS.

[revealjs](https://revealjs.com/)

For creating presentations in HTML, CSS & JS. This is **NOT** a presentation tool **MADE WITH**, HTML, CSS & JS

What im looking for is more an application for making:

[Google Slides](https://www.google.co.uk/slides/about/)

[Prezi](https://prezi.com/)

[Microsoft; Powerpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint)

- [ ] Security, Users

What:

**Self-employment Application**

Category: 

- Hobby based
 
Why:

- I was self employed for 3 years, for them 3 years, I used 3 systems to try and handle and create my invoicing.
- I used a tool called boost to track the ammount of hours I work on a given project. (**Time Tracking**)
- And I then used a micrsoft spreadsheet, to calculate how much time should be charged. (**Accounting**)
- I then used adobe indesign, to create the final invoice to send to the client. (**Invoicing**)
- I always wished that I could streamline this process as it used to take me around a 1/2 hours to complete each month.
- This could also be expanded to include my tax return records/spending, which is another process that takes alot of time for me to manage.
