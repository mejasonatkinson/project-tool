What:

**Self-employment Application**

Category: 

- Hobby based
 
Why:

- I was self employed for 3 years, for them 3 years, I used 3 systems to try and handle and create my invoicing.
- I used a tool called boost to track the ammount of hours I work on a given project. (**Time Tracking**)
- And I then used a micrsoft spreadsheet, to calculate how much time should be charged. (**Accounting**)
- I then used adobe indesign, to create the final invoice to send to the client. (**Invoicing**)
- I always wished that I could streamline this process as it used to take me around a 1/2 hours to complete each month.
- This could also be expanded to include my tax return records/spending, which is another process that takes alot of time for me to manage.
